# Past time

I wish I could hate you
The same way you hate me
I wish I could possess your same inner peace

You can't stand that I can't speak when I am
Stressed
Or sad
Or feeling heavy with you

I'm sorry I can be so hard to talk to

We are fireside breathing with your hand on my thigh
I'd smother the sorrows from our sonnets
But the smoke is in my eyes
I'm wrapping twine around my pinky, turning it purple just for fun
Next time you claim you miss me,
know you're not the only one
Because now I don't know how I feel about January nights or sunset views
Or long stares or cold tea or aubades for you

I miss me too
And I'm sorry I'm so hard to talk to

I'll break the lines of the smile in your eyes that weep
Now lay your head down
Forget me
Go to sleep

Oh, my muse
My playmate
You silly past time of mine
